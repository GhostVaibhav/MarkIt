# :golf:Contribution guidelines
First of all thank you:tada: for making any contributions (whatsoever) in this _repository_:file_folder:, have a look at the template:ticket:	 for submitting your contributions:


Submit your **contributions** in the form of a **PR**. To make any changes, _fork the project_ and modify it. Be sure to check all of these things before hand:

:heavy_check_mark: Be consistent with the **style of formatting** used:page_facing_up: (_i.e **4 spaces or 2 tabs**_).

:heavy_check_mark: Give an appropriate _title_ to the **PR**:dart: and also explain a little about any :warning:**problems fixed**/:x:**issues resolved**/:beginner:**features added** in the _description_.

:heavy_check_mark: Last but not the least, have a look at the **checks**:clipboard:. If any of the core checks have :x:**failed** (_i.e builds for any Linux/MacOS/Windows_), then consider closing the **PR**:red_circle: and resolving the issues (_if any_).

:pushpin:And at last, I will review the changes which can take anywhere from around a day or two. If I found everything alright:white_check_mark:, I will merge your changes in the **development** branch:chart_with_upwards_trend:. If I have any _ambiguity_:thinking:, then I will text a follow up:speech_balloon: in the same **PR** thread.

_Happy contributing_:wink:
